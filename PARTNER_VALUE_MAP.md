# Partner Value Map (Differentiation)

What partners feel immediately and why it compounds.

## Core Differentiators
- Lead Sniper Precision: surfaces non-obvious, multi-source signals earlier than humans.
- Explainable Confidence: confidence bands, drivers, and narratives make action safe.
- Autonomous Chaining: Scout→Extract→Predict→Rank→Report with clear handoffs and checkpoints.
- Memory Flywheel: session-aware rehydration improves over time without manual curation.

## Investor Angle
- Velocity: minutes from config to first actionable list.
- Compounding: more runs → better features → better predictions → higher conversion.
- Measurable: lead score uplift, time-to-signal delta, cost-per-conversion decline.

## GTM / Channel Partners
- White-labelable chains with bounded risk (demo-safe)
- Industry presets (energy, SMB distress, real estate) out-of-the-box
- Operator-first outputs: CSVs, dashboards, and narratives ready for outreach

## Enterprise Buyers
- Pluggable adapters; no lock-in to one LLM or crawler
- Predictive transparency with banding and driver breakdowns
- Clear merge boundaries: auditors can lock down without blocking capability
