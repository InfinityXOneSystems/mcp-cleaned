# Workflow (A–Z)

## A) Acquire signals
- Pull public/partner/licensed feeds into a normalized SignalEvent table.
- Instrument first-party web intent (forms, chat, abandonment, pricing page activity).

## B) Normalize + enrich
- Deduplicate businesses (name/website/address).
- Enrich firmographics (industry, size) via licensed provider or partner CRM.

## C) Score
- Compute LoanNeedPropensity 30/60/90.
- Compute ApprovalLikelihood (as soon as intake starts).

## D) Route
- High score + high approval → rep fast lane.
- High score + missing docs → automated “doc chase” workflow.
- Medium score → nurture sequences.
- Low score → long-term educational drip.

## E) Engage + close
- Multichannel cadence: email + SMS + call.
- AI agent assists reps: summarizes, proposes scripts, flags compliance, suggests next-best-action.

## F) Fund + service
- Post-funding: retention + refinance triggers; proactive check-ins; referral asks.

## G) Learn
- Every outcome is training data: funded/lost, time-to-close, default signals, channel attribution.
