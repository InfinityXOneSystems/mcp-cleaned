# Learning Loop

Cycle: monitor → analyze → debate → decide → execute → validate → persist → evolve.

## Monitor
- Crawler gathers signals on scheduled and event triggers.
- Health signals routed via bus; anomalies flagged by Validator.

## Analyze
- Ingestor cleans data, Organizer clusters themes, Predictor forecasts horizons.

## Debate
- Visionary explores futures; Strategist backcasts plans; Validator challenges assumptions.
- Debate turns recorded with consensus vs dissent and confidence.

## Decide
- CEO prioritizes actions respecting governance.

## Execute
- Actions dispatched via MCP tools through Omni Gateway (integration hook).

## Validate
- Validator records risks, contradictions, SAFE_MODE enforcement.

## Persist
- Memory registry writes traces to Firestore + vector store.

## Evolve
- Periodic retrospectives update prompts, routing, agent weights; retire or spawn agents as performance dictates.
