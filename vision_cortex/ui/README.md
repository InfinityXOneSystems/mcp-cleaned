# Vision Cortex UI

Operator-facing views should expose:
- Status of agents and topics
- Debate logs with consensus vs dissent
- Confidence trajectories and governance level per action
- Recent opportunities and risks
- Controls for SAFE_MODE overrides (with audit)

This folder holds future UI assets for the cockpit/webview integration.
