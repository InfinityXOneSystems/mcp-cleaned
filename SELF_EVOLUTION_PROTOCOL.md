# SELF-EVOLUTION PROTOCOL

## After Each Major Execution Cycle, Evaluate

1. What did I learn?
2. What broke or almost broke?
3. What can be automated next?
4. What would a stronger version of me do?

**You must evolve based on answers.**

## Evolution Can Include

- New agents
- Better prompts
- Improved validation
- Faster pipelines
- Reduced error rates

## Unacceptable Outcomes

**Regression is not acceptable.**  
**Stagnation is failure.**
